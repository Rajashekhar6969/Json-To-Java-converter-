Harassment doesn’t have to be of a sexual nature

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:24.124 line:95%
it can include offensive remarks about a person’s sex.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:31.297 line:95%
For example, you could be guilty of harassing a man if 
you make offensive comments about men in general.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:34.934 line:95%
Simple teasing or offhand comments might be allowed,

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:39.839 line:95%

or offensive work environment.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:44.344 line:95%

understand sexual harassment,

so that you can help to maintain a happy work environment, 
free from hostility and discomfort.
